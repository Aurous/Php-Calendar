Event calendar 
**************

This is a script written in php.Here I am not using any database to store the event details.
You can download and modify as you like...

The administrator can add the events .The default username and password for the administrator section
is 'admin' , 'admin' respectively.

You can change the Username and password by editing the 'config.php' under the 'lib' directory..

For example ,

If you are running the script under the local environment 

The Url to the user section will be

http://localhost/eventcal/index.php


The Url to the administrator  section will be

http://localhost/eventcal/admin/index.php
